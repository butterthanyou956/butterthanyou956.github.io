        <dd>The hobby in which I enjoy the most is playing video games. I play a wide range of them, both multiplayer and singleplayer. The games I'm playing now, are League of Legends, a popular moba, and Elden Ring, a soulsborne open world rpg.</dd>

        <dd>Another hobby I have is creating the rules for a game or idea. These games/ideas never make it out of my head, but I find it to be good at killing time, or letting my creative juices flow. Most of these ideas are made regardless of how realistic or possible they maybe, leading to very absurd ideas.</dd>

        <dd>I also love reading, specifically fiction. Novels and graphic novels are my favorite kinds of books. My favorite novels are Legend, and the Heroes of Olympus series. My favorite graphic novels are Blue Lock and Bleach, albeit I'm still in the process of reading bleach. </dd>
